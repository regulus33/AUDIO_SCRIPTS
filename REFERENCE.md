## Dependency Management in Ruby and Python

### Ruby: Gemfile
In Ruby projects, dependencies are managed using a `Gemfile`. This file specifies the gems (libraries) required for the Ruby application. When you run `bundle install`, Bundler processes the `Gemfile` and automatically installs the necessary gems, considering the correct versions as specified.

### Python: requirements.txt
Python projects typically use a `requirements.txt` file, which lists all the necessary packages. These packages are installed using `pip` (Pythonâ€™s package installer) with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Unlike the `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt` doesn't resolve dependencies but lists all required packages and their versions.

### Virtual Environments in Python
Virtual environments in Python are used to create isolated environments for Python projects. This ensures that each project has its own dependencies and Python versions, separate from other projects or the global Python environment. This isolation prevents conflicts between project dependencies and makes dependency management more reliable and straightforward. You can create a virtual environment using `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`.
